Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and classifying user’s opinion from a piece of text into different emotions and sentiments. Sentiment analysis which is also known as opinion mining is used to discover how people feel about a particular situation or topic. The analysis of data obtained can be computed into sentiments like positive, negative or neutral and emotions like happy, sad and neutral. This analysis can be used in different areas such as student feedback systems, movie reviews, product reviews, opinion polls, etc. For example, many educational institutions obtain the feedbacks of their teaching staff from the students using a sentiment analysis system to calculate the performance of the staff.

Our proposed Sentiment Analysis system helps to recognize emotion and later performs sentiment identification. Emotions are classified into three categories, happy, joy and sadness. Sentiments are classified into three categories, positive, neutral and negative. From these sentiments and emotional categories, we can compute satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

Functionalities
• Data collection
• Data pre-processing
• Emotion recognition
• Sentiment identification
• Data visualization

Data Collection:
Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established systematic fashion, which then enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes.

Data Pre-processing:
Data pre-processing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviours or trends, and is likely to contain many errors.

Emotion Recognition:
• Emotion recognition is the main aspect of our project.
• Emotions are classified into four categories, happy, sad and neutral.

Sentiment Identification:
• Sentiment identification is the process of identifying the overall sentiment of particular data set.
• Sentiments are classified into three categories, positive, neutral and negative.
• From these sentiments and emotional categories, we can compute satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

Data Visualization:
• Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context.
• Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software.
• Visualization can be done through bar graphs, pie charts, etc.
